In just a few years, the payment landscape in Senegal has radically changed. Where traditional banks struggled to reach the majority of the population, fintechs and mobile money operators have achieved a remarkable feat: democratizing access to financial services and, more recently, to international banking cards. From Yas (formerly Free Senegal) which paved the way with its Mastercard, to Wave which just launched its virtual Visa card, through Djamo and Orange Money's recent Mastercard, a new era is opening for Senegalese people.

This transformation is not limited to a simple multiplication of payment options. It reflects a deep disruption of the traditional banking sector and a redefinition of financial inclusion in a country where only 22% of the population has a traditional bank account, but where **70% use mobile money** and where penetration even reaches **210%** according to some estimates.

### **The History of Digital Banking Cards in Senegal**

#### **Yas (Free Senegal): The Pioneer That Opened the Way**

It was Free Senegal (became Yas in 2024) that launched the first Mastercard banking card accessible via mobile money in Senegal. Free Money Mastercard allowed customers to have a virtual card for 1,000 FCFA and a physical card for 2,500 FCFA, offering them the possibility to make online payments, in-store purchases, and international transactions without needing a traditional bank account.
This major innovation aimed to bridge the gap between the global digital economy and the millions of Senegalese excluded from traditional banking circuits. For the first time, a student, freelancer, or small merchant could access Netflix, Amazon, pay on Alibaba, or book on Booking.com without going through the administrative burdens of a bank.
However, the service experienced temporary interruptions before being relaunched under a new identity. In June 2025, Mixx by Yas (the fintech branch of Yas Senegal, a subsidiary of the AXIAN Telecom group) officially launched the **Mixx Mastercard prepaid card** in partnership with Mastercard and Ecobank Senegal. This modernized and secure card particularly targets young people, independent workers, students, and small businesses, allowing them to make transactions without a traditional bank account.

#### **Djamo: The Pan-African Fintech That Stands Out**

Djamo, an Ivorian fintech present in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire, has positioned itself as a robust alternative to traditional banks. With Djamo, users open a free account in one minute and immediately receive a **free virtual Visa card**. They can then order a **physical Visa card** delivered in 48 hours and use it to withdraw money, pay without fees anywhere in the world, save, transfer, and receive their salary.
Djamo stands out for its simple value proposition: **transparency, fair rates, and total control over your money**. Withdrawals and payments in the UEMOA zone are free, and users benefit from real-time notifications, automatic expense categorization, and even cashback on their payments. The Djamo card works at more than 32 million merchants in more than 200 countries.

#### **Wave: The Dominant Mobile Money Player Enters the Card Market**

Wave, the undisputed leader of mobile money in Senegal with millions of users, recently took a decisive step by launching its **virtual Visa card** in May 2025. This card, free and activatable in two clicks from the Wave app, allows users to make international online purchases securely and at advantageous rates.
The Wave virtual Visa card directly interconnects with the customer's Wave electronic money account, in partnership with Ecobank which provides the card under its regulatory responsibility and BIN. Users can block, unblock, or delete their card instantly from the app, offering total control.
To promote adoption, Wave launched a campaign in December 2025 allowing users to win PS5s, iPhones, subscriptions, and even 1 million FCFA by using their card. This aggressive strategy reflects Wave's ambition to dominate not only mobile money but also online payments in Senegal.

#### **Orange Money: The Telecom Giant Joins the Dance**

On November 28, 2025, Orange Money officially launched its **Mastercard prepaid card** in Senegal, marking a major turning point. This card, the result of a strategic partnership between Orange Middle East and Africa (OMEA), Mastercard, and Orange Bank, aims to strengthen financial inclusion in seven sub-Saharan African countries, including Senegal.
The Orange Money Mastercard allows users to make local and international payments, online purchases, and withdrawals, all securely thanks to Mastercard's international standards. Customers can request their virtual card directly via the Max it app.
**Youssoufa Sall**, General Manager of Orange Finance Mobile Senegal, stated: _"The launch of this card materializes a series of innovations initiated in recent months with Orange Bank, Mastercard, and Net International. The goal is twofold: to offer Senegalese people a universal means of payment and to strengthen our commitment to financial inclusion."_
**Mohamed Ben Omar**, Regional Director of Mastercard for North Africa and Francophone Africa, added: _"Senegal is a key market for us, with 75% of young people ready to adopt innovative payment methods. The Orange Money Mastercard opens the world to them: transactions in Senegal, Europe, Asia, America... the world is open."_
Security is a central pillar: predefined code for each transaction, dedicated servers for fraud detection, artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze user behavior, and compliance with Mastercard international standards.

### **The Mobile Money Boom in Senegal: The Numbers That Speak**

To understand this banking card revolution, we must first grasp the scale of the mobile money phenomenon in Senegal.

#### **Explosive Growth in Accounts and Transactions**

According to GSMA, the number of registered mobile money accounts in Senegal **quintupled between 2013 and 2023**, rising from 7 million to **38 million accounts**. Over the same period, transaction value multiplied by 3.3, reaching **230 million dollars** compared to 70 million in 2019. In 2022, Senegalese authorities already counted **29.2 million electronic money accounts**, more than double the levels at the start of the decade, far exceeding the number of bank accounts.

#### **Massive Economic Impact**

GSMA estimates that Senegal's GDP in 2023 was **6 billion dollars higher** than it would have been without mobile money. GDP per capita related to mobile financial services rose from approximately **20 dollars to 300 dollars** in ten years.

#### **Financial Inclusion Rate of 83%**

Thanks to mobile money, Senegal now shows a **financial inclusion rate of over 83%**, one of the highest in West Africa. **Mobile money penetration reaches 210%**, meaning some individuals own multiple mobile money accounts.
Senegal ranks among the leading African countries for bill payment via mobile money, with a **rate of 27%**. Additionally, **20% of mobile money users** in Senegal report having received funds from a relative living abroad in the past 30 days.

#### **Low Traditional Banking Penetration**

In contrast, only **22% of the population has a bank account**, and **credit card penetration barely reaches 5%**. This gap between mobile money access and traditional banking services access explains why mobile money-linked banking cards constitute a revolution: they allow transforming millions of mobile money users into actors in the global digital economy.\*\*\*

### **Traditional Banks Facing Fintech Disruption**

#### **Overview of Banks in Senegal in 2025**

The Senegalese banking sector remains dominated by traditional players: **UBA**, **Ecobank**, **BOA (Bank of Africa)**, **Société Générale Senegal**, **CBAO Attijari Wafa Bank**, **BICIS**, **BHS (Banque de l'Habitat du Sénégal)**, and the **Banque Islamique du Sénégal (BIS)**.
These banks are now massively betting on **mobile banking** with dedicated applications, offering **deals without income or deposit conditions** to promote banking inclusion, and developing **packaged accounts** (account + card + mobile + insurance at a single price). Some, like BIS, are also exploring **Islamic finance**.

#### **Strategic Partnerships with Fintechs**

Facing the existential threat that fintechs represent, traditional banks have chosen collaboration over confrontation. Almost all major banks have formed **partnerships with Orange Money, Wave, Wizall, and other mobile money players**. These partnerships enable interoperability: transfers between bank accounts and mobile money wallets, cash withdrawals via mobile money agents, and even bill payments.
Ecobank, for example, is Wave's banking partner for issuing the virtual Visa card, and Mixx by Yas's partner for the Mastercard. These collaborations allow banks to remain relevant by leveraging fintech infrastructure and user base, while maintaining their regulatory role and compliance expertise.

#### **Structural Limitations of Traditional Banks**

Despite these efforts, traditional banks face major **structural limitations**:

**Heavy and bureaucratic processes**: Opening a bank account requires identity documents, proof of residence, and sometimes a minimum deposit. Fintechs, on the other hand, allow opening an account in one minute with just a phone number.

**Expensive physical branches**: Banks must maintain an expensive branch network, while fintechs operate entirely via mobile with minimal operational costs.

**Uncompetitive pricing**: Banking fees (account maintenance, transfers, out-of-network withdrawals) remain high compared to fintechs' transparent and often free rates.

**Low rural penetration**: Bank branches are concentrated in urban areas, while mobile money agents are present even in the most remote villages.

These constraints explain why, despite historical presence and financial strength, traditional banks struggle to conquer the masses. Fintechs, agile and digital by nature, directly capture this underbanked clientele.

### **The Senegalese Fintech Ecosystem: Fertile Ground**

Senegal stands out as a **dynamic player in financial innovation in West Africa**. With its high financial inclusion rate, exceptional mobile money penetration, and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment, the country offers **fertile ground for fintech development**.

#### **Regulation and Innovation**

The **BCEAO (Central Bank of West African States)** plays a key role in regulating and promoting fintechs in the UEMOA zone. It aims to increase fintech visibility, present sector initiatives, and track their evolution, to ensure better knowledge and adapted regulation.
Senegal also hosted the **Next Fintech Forum 2025** on November 20-21 in Dakar, the unmissable meeting for finance and technology in Africa. This event brings together major African fintech players and testifies to the dynamism of the Senegalese ecosystem.

#### **Diversity of Players**

Beyond the mobile money giants (Orange Money, Wave, Free Money/Yas), the Senegalese fintech ecosystem includes:

- **Djamo**: Neobank offering accounts and Visa cards

- **Wizall Money**: Mobile payment service

- **E-money Transfer**: Money transfer platform

- **JumiaPay**: Jumia's digital wallet, with full launch expected in 2025
  These players position themselves on different segments: payments, international transfers, savings, microcredit, and insurance services. Together, they are redefining access to financial services for millions of Senegalese.

### **Comparative Analysis: Which Service to Choose?**

With this multiplication of banking card offers, Senegalese consumers find themselves facing an expanded choice. Here is a synthetic comparison:

| **Service**                   | **Card Type**               | **Price**       | **Strengths**                                                      | **Limitations**                             |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Mixx by Yas (Mastercard)**  | Virtual and physical        | Variable        | Pioneer, inclusion of youth and freelancers                        | Service temporarily interrupted in the past |
| **Djamo (Visa)**              | Free virtual, paid physical | Free (virtual)  | Free UEMOA zone, cashback, intuitive interface                     | Need for a separate Djamo account           |

| **Orange Money (Mastercard)** | Virtual and physical        | To be confirmed | Powerful Orange network, Mastercard security, global acceptance    | New, limited user feedback                  |

#### **Mixx by Yas**

**Advantages**: Pioneer in the field, former Free Money has established experience. Partnership with Mastercard and Ecobank guarantees security and international acceptance. Targets youth, freelancers, and students.

**Disadvantages**: History of temporary service interruptions, which may worry some users about long-term reliability.

#### **Djamo**

**Advantages**: Complete neobank with integrated budget management, real-time notifications, automatic savings via "pockets", cashback on payments. Free withdrawals and payments throughout the UEMOA zone. Modern and intuitive interface.

**Disadvantages**: Virtual card only for now, no physical card. Features limited to online payments, no ATM withdrawals.

#### **Orange Money**

**Advantages**: Powerful and omnipresent Orange network in Senegal. Partnership with Mastercard guarantees global acceptance. Enhanced security with AI and fraud detection. Virtual and physical cards available.

**Disadvantages**: Very recent service (launched late November 2025), so limited user feedback. Pricing and terms of use still to be clarified.

### **Challenges to Address**

Despite this positive dynamic, several challenges remain for players in the Senegalese fintech and banking ecosystem.

#### **Mobile Money Taxation**

In 2025, the Senegalese government introduced a **tax on mobile money transactions**, a bold but controversial decision. This tax aims to generate additional tax revenue in a constrained budgetary context, but it risks slowing mobile money adoption and penalizing the most vulnerable populations who depend on these services for their daily transactions.According to Finance in Africa, this tax could **reverse a decade of progress in digital financial inclusion**. Sector players are calling for a revision of this policy to preserve the positive momentum of mobile money.

#### **Security and Trust**

With the increase in digital transactions, risks of fraud, phishing, and hacking also increase. Fintechs must invest massively in cybersecurity, strong authentication, and user education to maintain trust.

#### **Financial Education**

Many Senegalese, particularly in rural areas, are not familiar with banking cards, online payments, and basic financial management concepts. A significant effort in education and awareness is necessary to maximize the impact of these innovations.

#### **Interoperability and Standards**

Although interoperability between mobile money and banks is progressing, frictions remain. Harmonizing standards, facilitating transfers between platforms, and ensuring a smooth user experience remain priorities.

---

### **Future Prospects**

The future of payments in Senegal looks resolutely digital, inclusive, and competitive.

#### **Physical Cards for Everyone**

Wave, which currently only offers a virtual card, could launch a physical Visa card in the coming months to fully compete with Djamo and Orange Money. This evolution would allow users to withdraw money from ATMs and pay in stores worldwide.

#### **Expansion of Financial Services**

Fintechs are no longer limited to payments. They are gradually integrating savings, credit, insurance, and even investment. Djamo, for example, already offers automatic savings "pockets". Orange Money is exploring microcredit offers. This diversification transforms mobile money wallets into true **financial super apps**.

#### **Artificial Intelligence and Personalization**

AI will play an increasing role in fraud detection, offer personalization, and user financial support. Predictive algorithms will help users better manage their budget, anticipate expenses, and optimize their savings.

#### **International Partnerships**

Senegalese fintechs could form partnerships with international players (Amazon, Alibaba, Netflix, Spotify) to facilitate access to their services and offer preferential rates. These collaborations would strengthen the appeal of local cards.

#### **Regional Expansion**

Senegalese players, strong from their local success, could extend their services to other UEMOA countries and beyond. Djamo is already present in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire. Wave operates in several West African countries. Orange Money covers seven countries with its new Mastercard. This regional expansion would allow cost sharing and benefit from economies of scale.

### **Conclusion: A Revolution in Motion**

From Yas (Free Senegal) which opened the way, to Wave, Djamo, and Orange Money which strengthen the offer, mobile money-accessible banking cards represent a **democratic revolution** in Senegal. They allow millions of Senegalese, until now excluded from the traditional banking system, to fully participate in the global digital economy: buy on Amazon, subscribe to Netflix, pay on Alibaba, book on Booking.com, or even receive international payments for freelancing.

This revolution is just beginning. With an **83% financial inclusion rate**, **210% mobile money penetration**, and a dynamic fintech ecosystem, Senegal stands out as a financial innovation laboratory in West Africa. Traditional banks, aware of the threat, are reinventing themselves by forming strategic partnerships with fintechs, but the balance of power has shifted: it is now fintechs that dictate the tempo.

For Senegalese consumers, this is a historic opportunity: **more choice, more control, and expanded access to financial services** that will shape tomorrow's economy. The next step? Transform these banking cards into true passports to total economic inclusion, digital entrepreneurship, and shared prosperity.

**Tomorrow's banking Senegal is no longer built in branches, but in smartphones.**
