On December 3, 2025, a catastrophic vulnerability was discovered in React 19 and Next.js 15. **CVE-2025-55182**, nicknamed **"React2Shell"**, allows an attacker to execute remote code on your server **without authentication, in a single HTTP request**.

CVSS Score: **10.0/10** (the absolute maximum).

In less than 48 hours, Chinese hackers, cybercriminals, and botnets exploited this flaw, compromising **more than 50 organizations** worldwide. And **50% of vulnerable applications remain unpatched** today.

### **What is CVE-2025-55182?**

It's a **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerability in React Server Components. An attacker can take complete control of your server by sending a simple malicious request to your React endpoints.

**Vulnerable versions:**

- React 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0
- Next.js < 15.0.5

**The worst part?** A Next.js application created with `create-next-app` is **vulnerable by default**.

---

### **Why is this serious?**

- **No authentication required**
- **No user interaction needed**
- **Exploitable remotely via the internet**
- **Complete server compromise**

An attacker can:

- Steal your databases
- Install backdoors
- Deploy ransomware or cryptominers
- Access your API secrets and credentials
- Move laterally to other systems on your network

---

### **Who is exploiting this vulnerability?**

**Chinese state groups**: Earth Lamia, Jackpot Panda
**North Korean hackers**: Contagious Interview
**Cybercriminals**: Botnets, cryptojackers, ransomware

**More than 15 distinct intrusion clusters** have been identified. The exploit is now in the wild and being used massively.

---

### **How to protect yourself (URGENT)**

#### **1. Patch IMMEDIATELY**

```bash
# React
npm install react@19.0.1 react-dom@19.0.1

# Next.js
npm install next@15.0.5
```

**Then rebuild and redeploy your application.**

#### **2. Check if you are vulnerable**

```bash
npm list react react-dom next
```

If you're using React 19.0.0-19.2.0 or Next.js < 15.0.5, **you are in danger**.

#### **3. Temporary mitigations (if patching is impossible)**

- Restrict network access to React Server Components endpoints
- Deploy a WAF (Cloudflare, Azure WAF, AWS WAF) with anti-React2Shell rules
- Isolate your Next.js applications from the rest of your infrastructure

#### **4. Monitor for compromises**

Look for in your logs:

- Suspicious POST requests to your Server Function endpoints
- Outbound connections to unknown IPs
- Unusual system command executions

---

### **Key takeaways**

CVE-2025-55182 is an **absolute emergency**. With a score of 10/10, massive exploitation underway, and 50% of applications still vulnerable, this is one of the most serious security crises in the modern web ecosystem.

**If you're using React 19 or Next.js 15, patch NOW. Not tomorrow, not next week. Now.**

Attackers won't wait for you.
